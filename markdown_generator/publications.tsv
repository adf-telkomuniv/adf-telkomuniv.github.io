One of the technologies that can be developed on the cellphone is computer vision. One of the uses of computer vision is object recognition that provides solutions to help to recognize objects. This research builds a system for recognition objects inside in house that is developed on a cellphone that is expected to help early childhood recognize objects in the surrounding. MobileNet is one of feature extraction that has good performance and efficient use on a cellphone. MobileNet architecture consists of a depthwise convolution layer and pointwise convolution layer in extracting features. The experiment also uses the architecture of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) as a method of detecting objects. We used MobileNet architecture as a pre-trained model that had previously been trained on COCO datasets, and implement transfer learning for 20 types of objects commonly found inside the house. The experimental result indicates that the mean Average Precision (mAP) of MobileNetV2 could exceed MobileNetV1 and InceptionV2 of 99.34%."	"Supriadi, M., Rachmawati, E., & Arifianto, A. (2021).

20-10-16	"Lip Motion Recognition for Indonesian Vowel Phonemes Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks,"	2020 3rd International Conference on Computer and Informatics Engineering (IC2IE)	"Lip motion recognition is a technique for interpreting visual data that focuses on the mouth area and aims to recognize lip movement. The development of lip motion recognition is expected to be used to develop communication tools with deaf people and to automate the speech-to-text process visually. In the Indonesian language, the existence of vowel phonemes is needed to produce sounds so that words and sentences in the Indonesian language can be formed. This paper proposes a model that can recognize Indonesian vowel phonemes (/a/, /i/, /u/, /e/, and /o/) in lip movements. We proposed a model that uses 3D Convolutional Neural Networks. The data in this paper were processed by resizing into 112x56 pixel resolution then, proceed to the data augmentation by reversing the data horizontally and add blur to the data. The results of the testing of the vowel phoneme recognition model on lip motion show the highest accuracy rate of 84%."	"Maxalmina, S. Kahfi, K. N. Ramadhani and A.

20-08-05	"Recognizing Soft Biometric on Pedestrian Using Convolutional Neural Network,"	2020 International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA)	"Video surveillance is very important in automatic surveillance. It is usually used to monitor any criminal activity and help to find the perpetrator. In the search for individual among pedestrians when the face image can no longer be recognized, then what can be recognized is the soft-biometric or attribute appears on the pedestrian. The attributes can be in the form of clothes or accessories worn by pedestrians. However, recognizing attributes is a more challenging task as the number of variations of the attribute is increasing. Therefore, there is a need of a system that can effectively recognize the soft-biometric of pedestrians that are expected to help in video surveillance. In this study, we propose a pedestrian soft-biometric recognition system that was built using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method so that it can search for pedestrians wearing various attributes. In recognizing pedestrian soft-biometric, the authors conducted a study using transfer learning from the Resnet50 architecture. As this case belongs to the multi-label classification case, we also observed several scenarios for determining the threshold to better classify the appearance of attributes. Our system able to recognize 35 different attributes with the best results of this research indicate the average accuracy of 90.82% with 80.84% of precision and 81.08% of recall using test data."	"T.

20-08-05	Developing an LSTM-based Classification Model of IndiHome Customer Feedbacks	2020 International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA)	"The development of companies in the service sector is inseparable from problems with the customer service process. The latest trends show that customers are more comfortable using social media and chat services as feedback delivery media compared to sending emails.In this study, we classify user feedback from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Indonesia named IndiHome. In this study, there are two test scenarios carried out to classify, the first scenario uses Short Term Memory combined with Word Embedding, and the second scenario uses Naive Bayes combined with TF-IDF. based on the test results, obtained accuracy on the LSTM method combined with Word Embedding with an f1 score of 87.98 % and accuracy obtained at Naive Bayes combined with TF-IDF with an f1 score of 76.77 %. From the tests that have been done, different results are obtained and have a big difference, which is 11.21%. The difference in the results of this classification is influenced by several factors, namely the first factor is the extraction of features used and the second is the data used. In feature selection, TF-IDF is more ideal for data that has a large or long document size because the representation seen from the whole document, in contrast to Word Embedding that is not affected by the data size because the representation is seen from words. so this is what causes the method of using LSTM combined with Word Embedding to produce higher results."

20-08-05	"Firefly Algorithm-based Hyperparameters Setting of DRNN for Weather Prediction, "	2020 International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA)	"A Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNN) is powerful to be used in sequential datasets. Quite hard tasks in DRNN is setting the optimum hyperparameters. There are known to be three types of general methods for searching the optimum DRNN hyperparameters: manual, grid, and random searches. However, these types of methods are not the right choice when a prior experience is insufficient. This paper addresses both the optimization and automation of hyperparameters to build its structure. They are carried out using a Firefly Algorithm (FA), one of the metaheuristic methods. The hyperparameters to be optimized and automated are batch size, dense, and total units in each layer. There are three things to consider in doing FA-based optimization in this test, such as designing FA, determining the initialization of fixed hyperparameters from the DRNN, and determining the range of DRNN hyperparameter values. Evaluation using the dataset of weather history recorded by the Max Planck Biogeochemical Institute, which contains 15 attributes, shows that the FA-based hyperparameters setting of DRNN gives a much lower prediction error of 0.111 than the manual tuning (0.475). Based on that result, when using FA for the optimization of DRNN hyperparameters in weather prediction, it reduces the error value, so the prediction results using DRNN are more accurate."	"L. F.

20-08-05	"Hyperparameter Setting of LSTM-based Language Model using Grey Wolf Optimizer,"	2020 International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA)	"Hyperparameters is one of the most essential part of deep learning, because they can give big impact to the performance of the model. Recent works show that if the hyperparameters of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are carefully adjusted or optimized, its performance can achieve the same performance as the more complex LSTM model. Previously, several methods such as grid search and random search is introduced to solve this hyperparameters optimization problem, but it is still not effective enough. Hence, it opens opportunities for meta-heuristic nature-inspired approach like Swarm Intelligence (SI) method to solve this hyperparameter optimization problem. The main advantage of this method is the behaviour of the algorithm that has exploring-exploiting process in order to find the global optima solution in the search space. Algorithm such as Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) are one of the SI algorithms that have a promising performance in optimization problem in various field. The algorithm has balanced exploring-exploiting process, that can make the optimization are more effective. Therefore, in this paper the GWO is exploited to optimize the LSTM hyperparameters for a language modeling task. Evaluation for the Penn Tree Bank dataset shows that GWO is capable of giving an optimum hyperparameters of the LSTM."	"B. Z. Aufa, S. Suyanto and A.

This approach is considered a good addition in securing information to cryptography which only hides the information and not the presence of the message itself. The combination of Deep Learning with Steganography and Cryptography is rarely done. By utilizing Deep Neural Networks to encrypt and hide the messages, it will be increasingly difficult to decrypt and track.In this study, we developed an encryption mechanism to not only conceal messages, but transforming them into images. The image containing the hidden messages can later be decrypted and converted back into the original message. We use Generative Adversarial Network to develop the encryption and decryption models. Text data is converted into a word vector using word2vec model which then used as input for the encryption model to produce the word images. We use the MNIST dataset to train models which are able to produce images that encrypt 1000 word variations. Based on our experiments, we were able to produce robust encrypted images with 98% accuracy of reversible words. We also show that our model is resistant to various minor image attacks such as scaling, noise addition, and image rotation."	"A.

21-06-24	"Adaptive Attention Generation for Indonesian Image Captioning, "	2020 8th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT)	"Image captioning is one of the most widely discussed topic nowadays. However, most research in this area generate English caption while there are thousands of language exist around the world. With their language uniqueness, there's a need of specific research to generate captions in those languages. Indonesia, as the largest Southeast Asian country, has its own language, which is Bahasa Indonesia. Bahasa Indonesia has been taught in various countries such as Vietnam, Australia, and Japan. In this research, we propose the attention-based image captioning model using ResNet101 as the encoder and LSTM with adaptive attention as the decoder for the Indonesian image captioning task. Adaptive attention used to decide when and at which region of the image should be attended to produce the next word. The model we used was trained with the MSCOCO and Flick30k datasets besides. Both datasets are translated manually into Bahasa by human and by using Google Translate. Our research resulted in 0.678, 0.512, 0.375, 0.274, and 0.990 for BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4, and CIDEr scores respectively. Our model also produces a similar score for the English image captioning model, which means our model capable of being equivalent to English image captioning. We also propose a new metric score by conducting a survey. The results state that 76.8% of our model's caption results are better than validation data that has been translated using Google Translate."	"M. R. S. Mahadi, A. Arifianto and K. N.

21-06-24	"End-to-End Speech Recognition Models for a Low-Resourced Indonesian Language,"	2020 8th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT)	"Recent automatic speech recognition (ASR) is commonly developed using deep learning (DL), instead of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Many researchers show that DL is much better than HMM in noisy environments. However, DL needs a huge speech corpus but does not require any dictionary as well as the concept of either phonemes or syllables. Many DL-based tools are developed and claimed as a language-independent ASR, such as Mozma DeepSpeech (MDS) and Kaituoxu SpeechTransformer (KST). Both MDS and KST are classified as End-to-End ASR (E2EASR), but MDS uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) while KST exploits a Transformer Network. In this paper, two Indonesian ASR (INASR) are developed using both MDS and KST to see their performances to handle a low-resourced language. Evaluation using a small speech corpus of Bahasa Indonesia containing 40 k utterances shows that KST is slightly better than MDS, where it gives a word error rate (WER) of 22.00% while MDS produces a WER of 23.10%."

However, the recognizable facial expressions use the entire area of the face image, while the expression can be recognized from the change of face fiducial point on the eyes and lips only. In this study, the introduction of facial expressions was developed using LGBP-TOP and SVM methods by focusing on facial and lip images only. Therefore, an algorithm is needed to extract the eye and lip area of the face ima-ge using 3x3 blocks and 4x4 blocks, which will then be used as input on the LGBP-TOP method. After the image of the eyes and lips extracted its features, the extraction results are classified using the SVM method.

One way the celebrities promotes the products they endorse is through various online social media like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. However, there are many cases where product owners merely choose any famous celebrities to promote their products based on the fame of the artist without a proper analysis. We think that it is important to consider the chance of sales success viewed from a match between promoted items and the tastes or likeness of the artist's fans. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically recommend what types of product to endorse for an Instagram user based on his/her followers' profiling. We use Instagram to perform a user profiling to determine what the follower users like based on annotation tags of the images they upload. By using a clustering method to group the followers, we were able to provide an endorsement recommendation to a user that matched with the followers' preferences."	"A.

In modern countries, license plate recognition has been developed to collect traffic activity information. The performance of license plate recognition system tend to drop when the input picture contains noises like illumination, dirt, and scratches which cover one or more characters in the license plate. This research was focused on Indonesian license plate as many license plates in Indonesia had various noises like plastic cover and scratches which complicate the recognition. In this study, Indonesian license plate recognition is formed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is known to have good performance in recognizing objects, even though the objects are obscured to some degree. Sliding window is used in this study for replace character segmentation. CNN will predict images in every area of window. The highest performance for the whole system to the normal data test is 87.36% and noised data test is 44.93%."	"I. W. Notonogoro, Jondri and A.

Indonesia is on the third highest position in the number of malaria incident in South East Asia, with 229,819 confirmed cases and 432 deaths only at 2010. Previous work has demonstrated the potential of neural networks in predicting the behavior of complex, non-linear systems. GMDH Polynomial Neural Network was applied in a great variety of areas for data mining and knowledge discovery, forecasting, systems modeling, optimization, and pattern recognition. Study has also shown the close relation between Malaria incidence and weather pattern. This paper proposed a modified GMDH Polynomial Neural Network to reduce the learning time and computation while maintaining the accuracy in predicting Malaria incidence by relating it to weather pattern. Based on the experiments, it was proven that the modified GMDH PNN was able to reduce the learning time by 72% and improve the accuracy into 88.02% compared to the original GMDH PNN."
