02-04-21	Pembangunan Aplikasi Mobile Pengenalan Objek Untuk Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini	"Jurnal Teknologi Informasi dan Ilmu Komputer (JTIK), Vol. 8"	"Mobile phone usage has been very close to early childhood life, so giving rise to some negative impact on early childhood, especially reduced interaction with the surrounding world. One of the technologies that can be developed on the cellphone is computer vision. One of the uses of computer vision is object recognition that provides solutions to help to recognize objects. This research builds a system for recognition objects inside in house that is developed on a cellphone that is expected to help early childhood recognize objects in the surrounding. MobileNet is one of feature extraction that has good performance and efficient use on a cellphone. MobileNet architecture consists of a depthwise convolution layer and pointwise convolution layer in extracting features. The experiment also uses the architecture of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) as a method of detecting objects. We used MobileNet architecture as a pre-trained model that had previously been trained on COCO datasets, and implement transfer learning for 20 types of objects commonly found inside the house. The experimental result indicates that the mean Average Precision (mAP) of MobileNetV2 could exceed MobileNetV1 and InceptionV2 of 99.34%."	"Supriadi, M., Rachmawati, E., & Arifianto, A. (2021).

16-10-20	"Lip Motion Recognition for Indonesian Vowel Phonemes Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks,"	2020 3rd International Conference on Computer and Informatics Engineering (IC2IE)	"Lip motion recognition is a technique for interpreting visual data that focuses on the mouth area and aims to recognize lip movement. The development of lip motion recognition is expected to be used to develop communication tools with deaf people and to automate the speech-to-text process visually. In the Indonesian language, the existence of vowel phonemes is needed to produce sounds so that words and sentences in the Indonesian language can be formed. This paper proposes a model that can recognize Indonesian vowel phonemes (/a/, /i/, /u/, /e/, and /o/) in lip movements. We proposed a model that uses 3D Convolutional Neural Networks. The data in this paper were processed by resizing into 112x56 pixel resolution then, proceed to the data augmentation by reversing the data horizontally and add blur to the data. The results of the testing of the vowel phoneme recognition model on lip motion show the highest accuracy rate of 84%."	"Maxalmina, S. Kahfi, K. N. Ramadhani and A.

The disease is hard to identified since the symptoms have similarities with other disease. An automatically classification system of skin cancer has been developed, but it still produced low accuracy. We use Convolutional Neural Network  to enhance the accuracy of the classification. There are 2 main scenarios conducted in this research using HAM10000 dataset which has 7 classes. We compared ResNet and VGGNet architectures and obtained ResNet50 with augmentation as the best model with the accuracy of 99% and 99% macro avg."	"Aliyah, Z., Arifianto, A., & Sthevanie, F. (2020).

02-10-20	Pneumonia Classification from X-ray Images Using Residual Neural Network	"Indonesia Journal on Computing (Indo-JC), Vol. 5, No. 2"	"Pneumonia is a virus, bacterium, and fungi infection disease which causes alveoli swelling and gets worse easily if it is not taken care of immediately. There are symptoms that can be recognized through x-ray images, for example the appearance of white mist in the lungs. A pneumonia classification system has already developed, but it still produced low accuracy. In this research we develop classification system by increasing the depth of CNN architecture using Residual Neural Network to improve accuracy from previous research. The dataset contains 2 classes which are pneumonia and normal, and trained to produce the best learning strategy with various scenarios. The model trained using data train that has been oversampling. The best scenario is achieved by ResNet152 architecture using dropout 0.5. This scenario achieved a result of 0.88 precision, 0.95 recall, 0.92 f1-score, and 0.89 of accuracy. The classification model on this research produces higher accuracy compared to the research of Enes Ayan, et.al. in 2019 which produced 0.87."	"Ahnafi, A. H., Arifianto, A., & Ramadhani, K. N.

06-08-20	"Recognizing Soft Biometric on Pedestrian Using Convolutional Neural Network,"	2020 International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA)	"Video surveillance is very important in automatic surveillance. It is usually used to monitor any criminal activity and help to find the perpetrator. In the search for individual among pedestrians when the face image can no longer be recognized, then what can be recognized is the soft-biometric or attribute appears on the pedestrian. The attributes can be in the form of clothes or accessories worn by pedestrians. However, recognizing attributes is a more challenging task as the number of variations of the attribute is increasing. Therefore, there is a need of a system that can effectively recognize the soft-biometric of pedestrians that are expected to help in video surveillance. In this study, we propose a pedestrian soft-biometric recognition system that was built using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method so that it can search for pedestrians wearing various attributes. In recognizing pedestrian soft-biometric, the authors conducted a study using transfer learning from the Resnet50 architecture. As this case belongs to the multi-label classification case, we also observed several scenarios for determining the threshold to better classify the appearance of attributes. Our system able to recognize 35 different attributes with the best results of this research indicate the average accuracy of 90.82% with 80.84% of precision and 81.08% of recall using test data."	"T.
