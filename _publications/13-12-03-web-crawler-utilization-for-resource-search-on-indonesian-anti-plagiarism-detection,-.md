<b>Abstract</b> - 
Matching one document with other documents is one of anti-plagiarism tasks. Matching can be performed both intra and extra-corpal. This paper will discuss extra-corpal matching utilize the web crawlers as reference search. The role of web-crawler described in extra-corpal anti-plagiarism architecture. Matching of plagiarism indication will use Modified Histogram Intersection based on N-Gram of term. Similarity value utilizing modified normalized histogram intersection that devoted to matching extra corpal. Based on our experiment the best accuracy is given in 0.4 and 0.5 threshold value that give 94% accuracy.
