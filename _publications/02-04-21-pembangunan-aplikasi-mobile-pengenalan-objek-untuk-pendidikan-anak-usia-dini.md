excerpt: 'Mobile phone usage has been very close to early childhood life, so giving rise to some negative impact on early childhood, especially reduced interaction with the surrounding world. One of the technologies that can be developed on the cellphone is computer vision. One of the uses of computer vision is object recognition that provides solutions to help to recognize objects. This research builds a system for recognition objects inside in house that is developed on a cellphone that is expected to help early childhood recognize objects in the surrounding. MobileNet is one of feature extraction that has good performance and efficient use on a cellphone. MobileNet architecture consists of a depthwise convolution layer and pointwise convolution layer in extracting features. The experiment also uses the architecture of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) as a method of detecting objects. We used MobileNet architecture as a pre-trained model that had previously been trained on COCO datasets, and implement transfer learning for 20 types of objects commonly found inside the house. The experimental result indicates that the mean Average Precision (mAP) of MobileNetV2 could exceed MobileNetV1 and InceptionV2 of 99.34%.'
