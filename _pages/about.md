Hello. 
======

The name is Anditya Arifianto.

I received Bachelor degrees in Computer Science (2011) and Master’s degrees in Informatics Engineering (2013) at Telkom University, Indonesia. (previously Institut Teknologi Telkom).
Currently I am pursuing PhD at Nagoya University, Japan. under the guidance of Ichiro IDE-sensei.

I am an assistant professor at Faculty of Informatics (School of Computing), Telkom University, Indonesia, and I teach Bachelor degree Computer Science. I’ve been a lecturer here since 2013. I taught mainly in Algorithm and Programming lectures (Basic Programming and Algorithm, Data Structure, Object Oriented Programming, Internet Application Engineering); and Artificial Intelligence courses (Artificial Machine Intelligence, Machine Learning, Soft Computing, Convolutional Neural Network, Computer Vision)

I’ve been studying Artificial Intelligence since my Bachelor study and I’ve been intensely studying and researching in Deep Learning techniques, mainly in Convolutional Neural Network and Stacked AutoEncoder. I was the head of Artificial Intelligence Laboratory since 2016 to 2020.  

As of October 2020, I am pursuing my Doctoral degree at Nagoya University, Japan, under the guidance of Ichiro IDE-sensei.

Research in which I have my interest on are the development of Artificial Intelligence, especially in the case study of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Convolutional Neural Network. Previously, also involved in Text and Data Mining

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
