The name is Anditya Arifianto.

I received Bachelor degrees in Computer Science (2011) and Master’s degrees in Informatics Engineering (2013) at Telkom University, Indonesia. (previously Institut Teknologi Telkom).
Currently I am pursuing PhD at Nagoya University, Japan. under the guidance of Ichiro IDE-sensei.

I am an assistant professor at Faculty of Informatics (School of Computing), Telkom University, Indonesia, and I teach Bachelor degree Computer Science. I’ve been a lecturer here since 2013. I taught mainly in Algorithm and Programming lectures (Basic Programming and Algorithm, Data Structure, Object Oriented Programming, Internet Application Engineering); and Artificial Intelligence courses (Artificial Machine Intelligence, Machine Learning, Soft Computing, Convolutional Neural Network, Computer Vision)

I’ve been studying Artificial Intelligence since my Bachelor study and I’ve been intensely studying and researching in Deep Learning techniques, mainly in Convolutional Neural Network and Stacked AutoEncoder. I was the head of Artificial Intelligence Laboratory since 2016 to 2020.  

As of October 2020, I am pursuing my Doctoral degree at Nagoya University, Japan, under the guidance of Ichiro IDE-sensei.

Research in which I have my interest on are the development of Artificial Intelligence, especially in the case study of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Convolutional Neural Network. Previously, also involved in Text and Data Mining
